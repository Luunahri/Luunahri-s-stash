Hi! 

First I'd like to apologize for the amount of comments I did in this file, I've never done this kind of thing before and I wouldn't want anyone to get lost in the code I wrote.

This is a project of mine I decided to do because it didn't seem too complicated as well as it could prove useful to people like me who prefer to have convenient things in life, even the small ones!

I got an idea to make a program like this when I kept having to create folders for my HTML code in the /xampp/htdocs directory, as I don't have a real php server yet.

You can save this file as .BAT to get an even easier access to it, as it's just two clicks away.
I explained how to do so in the batExplanation.txt file.

Inside you will find the comments I mentioned before, which should generally explain what my thinking was when I was making that program.

That would be it from me, thank you for visting, I will try my best to learn Python more in-depth and make more projects in the future!

Luunahri out, ko-nya!
